# Research

The research tool performs multi-step web research by chaining web search, URL extraction, content fetching, and LLM summarization.

## How It Works

The research pipeline:

1. **Web Search** — Searches for the query using the configured search provider
2. **URL Extraction** — Extracts the most relevant URLs from search results
3. **Content Fetching** — Downloads and parses the content from each URL
4. **LLM Summarization** — Summarizes the gathered information into a coherent response

This produces much more thorough results than a single web search, as it actually reads and synthesizes the content of multiple pages.

## Usage

```
User: Research the current state of quantum computing in 2024
Agent: [uses research tool]
  → web_search: "quantum computing 2024 progress"
  → fetch: https://example.com/quantum-2024
  → fetch: https://another.com/quantum-advances
  → summarize: "Based on multiple sources..."
```

## Configuration

The research tool uses whatever search provider is configured:

```bash
export POCKETCLAW_WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER="tavily"
export POCKETCLAW_TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-..."
```

## Tool Schema
