# OCR

The OCR tool extracts text from images using a two-tier approach: GPT-4o Vision as the primary engine with pytesseract as a fallback.

## How It Works

1. **Primary**: Sends the image to GPT-4o Vision for intelligent text extraction
2. **Fallback**: If GPT-4o is unavailable, falls back to pytesseract (local OCR)

GPT-4o Vision produces superior results for complex layouts, handwriting, and non-standard text. Pytesseract works offline but is limited to printed text.

## Setup

```bash
# For GPT-4o Vision (primary)
export POCKETCLAW_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# For pytesseract fallback (optional)
# Install tesseract-ocr system package
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install tesseract           # macOS
```

## Usage

```
User: What does this image say? /path/to/screenshot.png
Agent: [uses ocr tool] → "The image contains the following text..."
```
