# Desktop

The desktop tools provide system-level interaction: capturing screenshots and monitoring system resources.

## Tools

### take_screenshot

Captures the primary monitor and saves the image.

```
User: Take a screenshot of my screen
Agent: [uses take_screenshot] → Screenshot saved to ~/.pocketclaw/file_jail/screenshots/screenshot_20240115_143022.png
```

Screenshots are saved to `~/.pocketclaw/file_jail/screenshots/` with timestamped filenames.

### get_status

Returns current system metrics — CPU usage, RAM, disk space, and battery status.

```
User: How's my system doing?
Agent: [uses get_status] → CPU: 23%, RAM: 8.2/16 GB (51%), Disk: 234/512 GB (46%), Battery: 78% (charging)
```

## Configuration

The desktop tools require the `desktop` optional dependency:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the desktop extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[desktop]
```

## Policy Group

Desktop tools belong to `group:desktop`. They are included in the `full` tool profile.

```bash
# Enable desktop tools
export POCKETCLAW_TOOLS_ALLOW="group:desktop"
```
