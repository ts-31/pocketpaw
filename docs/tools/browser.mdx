# Browser Automation

PocketPaw includes a browser automation tool powered by Playwright. Unlike screenshot-based approaches, it uses **accessibility tree snapshots** for reliable, fast interaction.

## How It Works

The `BrowserDriver` provides:

1. **Navigation** — Open URLs and navigate between pages
2. **Accessibility tree** — Get a structured representation of the page
3. **Ref map** — Maps reference numbers to CSS selectors for clicking/typing
4. **Interaction** — Click elements, type text, scroll, using ref numbers

### Why Accessibility Tree?

Instead of taking screenshots and using vision models, PocketPaw reads the page's accessibility tree. This is:

- **Faster** — No image processing or vision API calls
- **More reliable** — Structured data instead of visual interpretation
- **Cheaper** — No vision model tokens
- **Accessible** — Works with any page, including dynamic SPAs

## Usage

```
User: Go to news.ycombinator.com and find the top story

Agent: [uses browser tool]
  → navigate to "https://news.ycombinator.com"
  → accessibility tree shows: [1] "Story Title" link [2] "comments" link ...
  → click ref 1
  → read page content
```

## Configuration

The browser tool uses Playwright. Install it with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the browser extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[browser]
playwright install chromium
```

## NavigationResult

Each browser action returns a `NavigationResult`:

```python
@dataclass
class NavigationResult:
    url: str                    # Current URL
    title: str                  # Page title
    accessibility_tree: str     # Structured page content
    refmap: dict[int, str]      # Ref number → CSS selector mapping
```

## Policy Group

The browser tool belongs to `group:browser`. It's included in the `coding` profile.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the browser extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[browser]
```

This installs `playwright` as an optional dependency. You also need to install browser binaries:

```bash
playwright install chromium
```
