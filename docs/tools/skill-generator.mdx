# Skill Generator

The skill generator tool creates persistent skill definitions (SKILL.md files) that extend PocketPaw's capabilities across sessions.

## How It Works

1. The agent uses `skill_gen` to create a new skill
2. A SKILL.md file is written to `~/.pocketclaw/skills/`
3. The skill loader is reloaded to pick up the new skill
4. The skill is available in all future sessions

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a markdown file that provides instructions for the agent on how to handle specific types of requests. Skills can define:

- **Trigger phrases** — When the skill should be activated
- **Step-by-step instructions** — How to accomplish the task
- **Tool chains** — Which tools to use and in what order
- **Output templates** — How to format the response

## Example

```
User: Create a skill for writing daily standup summaries

Agent: [uses skill_gen tool]
  → Creates ~/.pocketclaw/skills/daily-standup.md
```

The generated skill file might contain:

```markdown
# Daily Standup Summary

## Trigger
When the user asks for a standup summary or daily update.

## Steps
1. Check the user's calendar for today's events
2. Review recent git commits (if in a project directory)
3. Summarize completed and upcoming tasks

## Output Format
- **Yesterday**: [completed items]
- **Today**: [planned items]
- **Blockers**: [any blockers]
```

## Skill Storage

Skills are stored in `~/.pocketclaw/skills/`:

```
~/.pocketclaw/skills/
├── daily-standup.md
├── code-review.md
└── meeting-notes.md
```

## Policy Group

Belongs to `group:skills`.
