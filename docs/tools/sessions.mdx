# Session Tools

PocketPaw provides six tools for managing conversation sessions. The agent invokes these automatically based on natural language — no special commands needed.

## Tools

### new_session

Start a fresh conversation. The previous session is preserved and can be resumed later.

```
User: Start a new conversation
Agent: [uses new_session] → Started new session. Previous conversation saved.
```

### list_sessions

List all sessions for the current chat, showing titles, message counts, and which one is active.

```
User: Show me my conversations
Agent: [uses list_sessions] →
  1. *Project planning* (12 messages) ← active
  2. Python debugging (8 messages)
  3. Recipe ideas (3 messages)
```

### switch_session

Switch to a different session by number or by searching titles.

```
User: Go back to the Python debugging conversation
Agent: [uses switch_session] → Switched to "Python debugging" (8 messages)
```

### clear_session

Clear all messages from the current session. The session itself is kept but history is wiped.

```
User: Clear this conversation
Agent: [uses clear_session] → Cleared 12 messages from current session.
```

### rename_session

Give the current session a new title.

```
User: Rename this conversation to "API Design Notes"
Agent: [uses rename_session] → Session renamed to "API Design Notes"
```

### delete_session

Permanently delete the current session and all its messages.

```
User: Delete this conversation
Agent: [uses delete_session] → Session deleted. Next message will start a fresh conversation.
```

## Parameters

All session tools require a `session_key` parameter (automatically provided by the system prompt). The `switch_session` tool additionally takes a `target` — either a session number from `list_sessions` or text to search in titles.

## Policy Group

Session tools belong to `group:memory` and are available in all tool profiles.
