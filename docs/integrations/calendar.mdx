# Google Calendar

PocketPaw can manage your Google Calendar with three tools: list, create, and search.

## Setup

1. Set up [Google OAuth](/integrations/oauth) credentials
2. Enable the Google Calendar API in your Google Cloud project
3. Authorize PocketPaw to access your calendar

## Tools

### calendar_list

List upcoming calendar events:

```
User: What's on my calendar for today?
Agent: [uses calendar_list] → You have 3 events today:
  - 9:00 AM: Team standup (30 min)
  - 11:00 AM: Design review (1 hr)
  - 2:00 PM: Client call (45 min)
```

### calendar_create

Create a new calendar event:

```
User: Schedule a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 3pm for 1 hour
Agent: [uses calendar_create] → Created event:
  "Meeting with Sarah" — Tomorrow 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM
```

### calendar_search

Search for events by keyword or date range:

```
User: When is my next dentist appointment?
Agent: [uses calendar_search] → Found: "Dentist appointment" on Feb 20 at 10:00 AM
```

## Policy Group

All Calendar tools belong to `group:calendar`.

## Required Scopes
