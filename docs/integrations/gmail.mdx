# Gmail

PocketPaw provides 9 tools for comprehensive Gmail management: search, read, send, label management, trash, and bulk operations.

## Setup

1. Set up [Google OAuth](/integrations/oauth) credentials
2. Enable the Gmail API in your Google Cloud project
3. Authorize PocketPaw to access your Gmail

## Tools

### gmail_search

Search your inbox using Gmail search syntax (`from:`, `subject:`, `is:unread`, `newer_than:1d`, etc.):

```
User: Find emails from John about the project deadline
Agent: [uses gmail_search] → Found 3 emails:
  1. "Re: Project deadline" from john@example.com (Jan 15)
  2. "Deadline update" from john@example.com (Jan 12)
  3. "Project timeline" from john@example.com (Jan 8)
```

Supports a `max_results` parameter (default: 5, max: 20).

### gmail_read

Read the full content of a specific email by message ID:

```
User: Read the first email
Agent: [uses gmail_read] → Subject: "Re: Project deadline"
  From: john@example.com
  Date: Jan 15, 2024
  Content: "Hi, the deadline has been moved to..."
```

### gmail_send

Send an email (plain text):

```
User: Reply to John saying we'll meet the deadline
Agent: [uses gmail_send] → Email sent to john@example.com
```

### gmail_list_labels

List all Gmail labels with their IDs and types:

```
User: Show me my Gmail labels
Agent: [uses gmail_list_labels] →
  - INBOX (system)
  - SENT (system)
  - Work/Projects (user) — Label_42
  - Newsletters (user) — Label_15
```

### gmail_create_label

Create a new Gmail label. Use `/` for nested labels:

```
User: Create a label called "Work/Urgent"
Agent: [uses gmail_create_label] → Created label "Work/Urgent" (Label_53)
```

### gmail_modify

Add or remove labels on a single email. Common label IDs: `INBOX`, `SPAM`, `TRASH`, `UNREAD`, `STARRED`, `IMPORTANT`.

```
User: Star that email and mark it as important
Agent: [uses gmail_modify] → Added STARRED, IMPORTANT to message
```

### gmail_trash

Move a message to trash:

```
User: Trash the spam email
Agent: [uses gmail_trash] → Message moved to trash
```

### gmail_batch_modify

Bulk label operations on multiple messages at once:

```
User: Mark all 5 newsletters as read and archive them
Agent: [uses gmail_batch_modify] → Modified 5 messages: removed UNREAD, INBOX
```
