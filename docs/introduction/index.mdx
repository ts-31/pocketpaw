PocketPaw is a **self-hosted AI agent** that runs on your machine and connects to Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and a built-in web dashboard. It gives you full control over your AI assistant with zero cloud lock-in.

## What is PocketPaw?

PocketPaw is an event-driven AI agent framework that bridges multiple messaging platforms to powerful language model backends. Send a message from any channel, and PocketPaw processes it through a configurable agent pipeline that can:

- **Execute code** on your machine via shell commands
- **Read and write files** on your local filesystem
- **Browse the web** with Playwright-based automation
- **Search the internet** via Tavily or Brave Search
- **Generate images** with Google's Gemini models
- **Manage your email** through Gmail integration
- **Control your calendar** via Google Calendar
- **Play music** with Spotify integration
- **And much more** via 30+ built-in tools

## Architecture at a Glance

PocketPaw follows an **event-driven message bus** architecture:

<img src="/pocketpaw-system-architecture.webp" alt="PocketPaw system architecture: event-driven MessageBus connecting 10+ channel adapters, agent processing pipeline with injection scanning, memory-augmented context building, three swappable LLM backends, and real-time streaming delivery." />

Every message flows through the bus, regardless of which channel it comes from. This makes it trivial to add new channels and ensures consistent behavior across all platforms.
