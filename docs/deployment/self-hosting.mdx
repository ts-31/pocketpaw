# Self-Hosting

PocketPaw is designed to be self-hosted. Here's how to deploy it on your own server.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **2GB RAM** minimum (4GB recommended with Mem0)
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows** (Linux recommended for servers)
- **Anthropic API key** (for Claude Agent SDK backend)

## Basic Deployment

### Install

```bash
# Create a dedicated user (optional)
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash pocketpaw

# Install PocketPaw
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

### Configure

Create the config file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pocketclaw
cat > ~/.pocketclaw/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-your-key",
  "agent_backend": "claude_agent_sdk",
  "tool_profile": "coding"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.pocketclaw/config.json
```

### Run

```bash
pocketpaw
```

The dashboard starts on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.

## Production Deployment

### Behind a Reverse Proxy

For production, put PocketPaw behind nginx or Caddy:

**Caddy (recommended)**:

```
pocketpaw.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

**nginx**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name pocketpaw.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/pocketpaw.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/pocketpaw.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The WebSocket connection requires `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers to be properly proxied. Without these, real-time streaming won't work.
</Callout>

### Environment Variables

Set environment variables in a `.env` file or your system's environment:

```bash
# /etc/pocketpaw/env
POCKETCLAW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
POCKETCLAW_DASHBOARD_HOST=127.0.0.1
POCKETCLAW_DASHBOARD_PORT=8000
POCKETCLAW_TOOL_PROFILE=coding
```

### Security Hardening

1. **Run as a dedicated user** — Don't run as root
2. **Restrict file permissions** — Config files should be 600
3. **Use a firewall** — Only expose the reverse proxy port
4. **Enable Guardian AI** — Active by default with Anthropic key
5. **Set allowed IDs** — Restrict channel access to specific users
6. **Run security audit** — `pocketpaw --security-audit`

## Resource Planning

| Component | RAM | CPU | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| PocketPaw core | ~100MB | Minimal | FastAPI + agent loop |
| Mem0 + Qdrant | ~500MB | Minimal | Embedded vector store |
| Ollama (local) | 4-16GB | GPU recommended | Depends on model size |
| Playwright | ~200MB | Moderate | Browser automation |

For a typical deployment with Claude Agent SDK (cloud) and Mem0 with Ollama:
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
