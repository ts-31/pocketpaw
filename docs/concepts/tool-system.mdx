# Tool System

PocketPaw's tool system provides 30+ built-in tools and supports custom tool creation. Tools are governed by a policy system that controls which tools are available.

<img src="/Tool-system-architecture-and-policy-system.webp" alt="Tool system architecture: 21 built-in tools across eight categories, ToolProtocol interface with dual-schema export, and three-tier policy engine (profiles, groups, allow/deny lists) with strict deny-wins precedence." />

## Tool Protocol

Every tool implements the `ToolProtocol`:

```python
class ToolProtocol(Protocol):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str: ...

    @property
    def description(self) -> str: ...

    @property
    def definition(self) -> ToolDefinition: ...

    async def execute(self, **kwargs) -> str: ...
```

The `ToolDefinition` provides schema export for both Anthropic and OpenAI formats, enabling tools to work with any backend.

## Tool Registry

The `ToolRegistry` is the central registry for all tools:

```python
from pocketclaw.tools.registry import ToolRegistry

registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.register(MyCustomTool())

# Get tool definitions for the agent
tools = registry.get_tool_definitions(format="anthropic")

# Execute a tool by name
result = await registry.execute("my_tool", param1="value")
```

The registry automatically filters tools based on the active [tool policy](/tools/tool-policy).

## Built-in Tools

PocketPaw ships with these built-in tools:

### Core Tools (Claude Agent SDK)
- **Bash** — Execute shell commands
- **Read** — Read files from the filesystem
- **Write** — Write files to the filesystem
- **Edit** — Edit existing files

### Search & Research
- **web_search** — Search the web via Tavily or Brave
- **research** — Multi-step web research chains

### Media
- **image_gen** — Generate images with Google Gemini
- **voice** — Text-to-speech (OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- **stt** — Speech-to-text (OpenAI Whisper)
- **ocr** — Extract text from images (GPT-4o Vision + pytesseract)

### Productivity
- **gmail** — Search, read, and send emails
- **calendar** — List, create, and search calendar events
- **gdrive** — List, download, upload, and share files
- **gdocs** — Read, create, and search documents

### Entertainment
- **spotify** — Search, playback, playlists, now playing
- **reddit** — Search, read threads, trending content

### Agent Tools
- **delegate** — Spawn sub-agents for parallel work
- **skill_gen** — Generate custom skill definitions

### Browser
- **browser** — Playwright-based web automation using accessibility tree snapshots

## Tool Groups

Tools are organized into groups for policy management:

| Group | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| `group:filesystem` | read_file, write_file, list_dir |
| `group:shell` | shell |
| `group:memory` | save_memory, recall_memory |
| `group:search` | web_search |
| `group:media` | image_gen, voice, stt, ocr |
| `group:gmail` | gmail_search, gmail_read, gmail_send |
| `group:calendar` | calendar_list, calendar_create, calendar_search |
| `group:drive` | gdrive_list, gdrive_download, gdrive_upload, gdrive_share |
| `group:docs` | gdocs_read, gdocs_create, gdocs_search |
| `group:spotify` | spotify_search, spotify_now_playing, spotify_playback, spotify_playlist |
| `group:reddit` | reddit_search, reddit_read, reddit_trending |
| `group:voice` | voice, stt |
| `group:research` | research |
| `group:delegation` | delegate |
| `group:skills` | skill_gen |
| `group:mcp` | All MCP server tools |

## Schema Export

Tools can export their definitions in both Anthropic and OpenAI formats:

```python
# Anthropic format (used by Claude Agent SDK)
{
    "name": "web_search",
    "description": "Search the web for information",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"}
        },
        "required": ["query"]
    }
}

# OpenAI format (used by Open Interpreter)
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "web_search",
        "description": "Search the web for information",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"}
            },
            "required": ["query"]
        }
    }
}
```
