# PocketPaw Native

The PocketPaw Native backend is a custom orchestrator that combines Anthropic's SDK for reasoning with Open Interpreter for code execution.

## Overview

This backend provides a balanced approach:

- **Anthropic SDK** handles conversation, reasoning, and tool selection
- **Open Interpreter** handles actual code execution
- **Custom tools** are registered through PocketPaw's tool registry
- **MCP tools** are loaded via `_get_mcp_tools()` and registered with the tool registry

## Configuration

```bash
export POCKETCLAW_AGENT_BACKEND="pocketpaw_native"
export POCKETCLAW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

## How It Works

1. The user message is sent to Claude via the Anthropic SDK
2. Claude decides which tools to call based on the available tool definitions
3. Tool calls are routed through PocketPaw's `ToolRegistry`
4. Code execution tools are delegated to Open Interpreter
5. Results are sent back to Claude for the next reasoning step
6. The cycle continues until Claude produces a final response

## Tool Registration

The native backend registers all tools from PocketPaw's tool registry:

```python
# Built-in tools (web_search, image_gen, etc.)
tools = registry.get_tool_definitions(format="anthropic")

# MCP tools (loaded from configured MCP servers)
mcp_tools = await _get_mcp_tools()
tools.extend(mcp_tools)
```

MCP tools are named with the pattern `mcp_<server>__<tool>` to avoid naming conflicts.

## Tool Policy

The tool policy system filters available tools. The native backend respects the same profiles and allow/deny lists as the Claude Agent SDK backend.

## When to Use

Choose PocketPaw Native when:

- You want more control over the tool execution pipeline
- You need to customize how tools are registered and executed
- You want to combine Anthropic's reasoning with Open Interpreter's execution capabilities

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the native extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[native]
```

This installs Open Interpreter as an optional dependency.
