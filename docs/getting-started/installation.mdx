# Installation

PocketPaw requires **Python 3.11+** and can be installed via pip or uv.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11** or higher
- **pip**, **uv**, or **pipx** package manager
- An **Anthropic API key** (for the default Claude Agent SDK backend)

## Quick Install

The fastest way to get started — the interactive installer handles Python, uv, and feature selection:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

Or install directly with pip:

```bash
pip install pocketpaw
```

This installs the core package with minimal dependencies (~10 packages). To add specific features, use extras.

## Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the recommended package manager for faster installs:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install for development
git clone https://github.com/pocketpaw/pocketpaw.git
cd pocketpaw
uv sync --dev
```

## Package Extras

PocketPaw uses a modular extras system. Install only what you need:

### Channel Extras

```bash
# Individual channels
pip install pocketpaw[telegram]
pip install pocketpaw[discord]
pip install pocketpaw[slack]
pip install pocketpaw[whatsapp-personal]  # QR-code pairing

# All channels
pip install pocketpaw[all-channels]
```

### Tool Extras

```bash
# Specific tools
pip install pocketpaw[browser]    # Playwright browser automation
pip install pocketpaw[image]      # Google Gemini image generation
pip install pocketpaw[memory]     # Mem0 semantic memory

# All tools
pip install pocketpaw[all-tools]
```

### Backend Extras

```bash
pip install pocketpaw[native]     # PocketPaw Native backend
pip install pocketpaw[desktop]    # Desktop automation tools
```

### Composite Extras

```bash
# Recommended setup (dashboard + common tools)
pip install pocketpaw[recommended]

# Everything included
pip install pocketpaw[all]

# Development (includes test and lint tools)
pip install pocketpaw[dev]
```

## Environment Variables

Set your API keys as environment variables. All PocketPaw settings use the `POCKETCLAW_` prefix:

```bash
# Required: Anthropic API key for Claude
export POCKETCLAW_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Optional: Other API keys
export POCKETCLAW_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # For voice/TTS/STT
export POCKETCLAW_TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-..."        # For web search
export POCKETCLAW_GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."             # For image generation
export POCKETCLAW_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="..."       # For Brave Search
```

Alternatively, you can configure these through the web dashboard's settings panel.

## Verify Installation

```bash
# Run PocketPaw (starts web dashboard)
pocketpaw

# Or with uv
uv run pocketpaw
```

The web dashboard will start at `http://localhost:8000`. Open it in your browser to verify everything is working.
