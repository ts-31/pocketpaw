# Security

PocketPaw implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers. Every message is checked before processing, every action is logged, and tools are governed by a policy system.

## Security Layers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Guardian AI">
    Secondary LLM evaluates every message for safety concerns. Messages classified as HIGH or CRITICAL are blocked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Injection Scanner">
    Two-tier detection (regex + LLM) catches prompt injection in both user messages and tool outputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Policy">
    Profiles and allow/deny lists control which tools are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dangerous Command Blocking">
    PreToolUse hooks intercept and block dangerous shell commands.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Audit Log">
    Append-only JSONL log records every significant action.
  </Step>
</Steps>
