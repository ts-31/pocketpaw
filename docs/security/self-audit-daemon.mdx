# Self-Audit Daemon

The self-audit daemon runs continuous security and health checks in the background, producing JSON reports.

## Overview

The daemon performs 12 checks at regular intervals:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Memory usage | Monitor RAM consumption |
| Disk space | Check available storage |
| API key rotation | Remind about old keys |
| Session cleanup | Remove stale sessions |
| Audit log rotation | Manage log file size |
| Config integrity | Validate configuration |
| Token expiry | Check OAuth token freshness |
| MCP health | Ping MCP servers |
| Process health | Monitor agent process |
| Network connectivity | Basic connectivity check |
| Dependency versions | Check for outdated packages |
| File permissions | Verify security-sensitive file permissions |

## Reports

Reports are saved as JSON in `~/.pocketclaw/audit/`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "checks": [
    {"name": "memory_usage", "status": "pass", "value": "245MB"},
    {"name": "disk_space", "status": "pass", "value": "45GB free"},
    {"name": "api_key_age", "status": "warn", "value": "90 days old"},
    {"name": "session_count", "status": "pass", "value": "23 active"}
  ],
  "summary": {
    "passed": 10,
    "warnings": 1,
    "failures": 1
  }
}
```

## Activation

The self-audit daemon starts automatically with the web dashboard. It can also be triggered manually via the dashboard's settings.
