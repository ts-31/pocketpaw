# Security Audit CLI

PocketPaw includes a built-in security audit that checks for common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

## Running the Audit

```bash
# Run all checks
pocketpaw --security-audit

# Run with auto-fix
pocketpaw --security-audit --fix
```

## Checks Performed

| # | Check | Description | Auto-Fix |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Config permissions | `config.json` should be 600 | Yes |
| 2 | API key exposure | Check for keys in env/logs | No |
| 3 | Audit log integrity | Verify log file is valid | No |
| 4 | Token storage | OAuth tokens have proper permissions | Yes |
| 5 | MCP configuration | Validate MCP server configs | No |
| 6 | Tool policy | Check for overly permissive policies | No |
| 7 | Guardian AI status | Verify Guardian AI is active | No |

## Output

The audit produces a report like:

```
PocketPaw Security Audit
========================

[PASS] Config file permissions: 600
[WARN] API key found in environment variable (expected)
[PASS] Audit log integrity: valid
[FAIL] Token file permissions: 644 (should be 600)
[PASS] MCP configuration: valid
[WARN] Tool policy: full profile (no restrictions)
[PASS] Guardian AI: active

Results: 4 passed, 2 warnings, 1 failure
```

## Auto-Fix

When run with `--fix`, the audit automatically resolves issues it can:

- Sets file permissions to 600 for config and token files
- Creates missing directories with proper permissions

Issues that require manual intervention (like API key management) are reported but not auto-fixed.
