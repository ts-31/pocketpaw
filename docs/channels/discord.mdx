# Discord

PocketPaw integrates with Discord via `discord.py`. It supports slash commands, direct messages, and @mention in channels.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Discord application">
    1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    2. Click "New Application" and name it
    3. Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
    4. Copy the bot token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set permissions">
    Under OAuth2 → URL Generator, select:
    - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
    - Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Use Slash Commands`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite to server">
    Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your Discord server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    ```bash
    export POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-discord-token"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start">
    ```bash
    pocketpaw --discord
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

| Setting | Env Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Bot token | `POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token |
| Allowed guilds | `POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS` | Comma-separated guild IDs |
| Allowed users | `POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Comma-separated user IDs |

## Features

### Slash Command

The bot registers a `/paw` slash command. Users can interact with:

```
/paw What files are in the home directory?
```

### DM and Mention Support

- **Direct messages** — Send a DM to the bot for private conversations
- **@mention** — Mention the bot in any channel where it's present

### Streaming

Discord supports edit-in-place streaming with a 1.5-second rate limit. The bot sends an initial message and edits it as tokens arrive, batching updates to respect Discord's rate limits.

### Access Control

```bash
# Restrict to specific servers
export POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS="111222333,444555666"

# Restrict to specific users
export POCKETCLAW_DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER_IDS="777888999"
```

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the Discord extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[discord]
```

This installs `discord.py` as an optional dependency.
