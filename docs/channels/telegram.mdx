# Telegram

PocketPaw supports Telegram via the `python-telegram-bot` library. It works as a standard Telegram bot with support for topics, inline keyboards, and streaming.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a bot">
    1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
    2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
    3. Copy the bot token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    ```bash
    export POCKETCLAW_TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start">
    ```bash
    # Telegram-only mode
    pocketpaw --telegram

    # Or via web dashboard (configure in Channels modal)
    pocketpaw
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

| Setting | Env Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Bot token | `POCKETCLAW_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | Bot token from BotFather |
| Allowed user IDs | `POCKETCLAW_ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_IDS` | Comma-separated user IDs |

## Features

### Streaming

Telegram supports edit-in-place streaming. The bot sends an initial message and then edits it as more tokens arrive, giving a real-time typing effect.

### Topic Support

PocketPaw supports Telegram's topic feature (available in groups with topics enabled). Each topic gets its own session:

- Session key format: `{chat_id}:topic:{topic_id}`
- Messages in different topics maintain separate conversation histories

### Access Control

Restrict access by specifying allowed Telegram user IDs:

```bash
export POCKETCLAW_ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_IDS="123456,789012"
```

Only users with these IDs can interact with the bot. If not set, anyone can use the bot.

### Commands

The bot responds to direct messages and can be configured with custom commands via BotFather's `/setcommands`.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the Telegram extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[telegram]
```

This installs `python-telegram-bot` as a dependency.
