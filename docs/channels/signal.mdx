# Signal

PocketPaw connects to Signal via the `signal-cli` REST API. Signal is ideal for users who prioritize privacy and end-to-end encryption.

## Prerequisites

You need a running [signal-cli-rest-api](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api) instance. This provides the HTTP API that PocketPaw communicates with.

```bash
# Run signal-cli REST API via Docker
docker run -d --name signal-api \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./signal-cli:/home/.local/share/signal-cli \
  bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api
```

Register your phone number with signal-cli before using it with PocketPaw.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start signal-cli REST API">
    Ensure signal-cli-rest-api is running and your number is registered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    ```bash
    export POCKETCLAW_SIGNAL_API_URL="http://localhost:8080"
    export POCKETCLAW_SIGNAL_PHONE_NUMBER="+1234567890"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start">
    ```bash
    pocketpaw --signal
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

| Setting | Env Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| API URL | `POCKETCLAW_SIGNAL_API_URL` | signal-cli REST API URL |
| Phone number | `POCKETCLAW_SIGNAL_PHONE_NUMBER` | Your registered Signal number |
| Allowed numbers | `POCKETCLAW_SIGNAL_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` | Comma-separated allowed numbers |

## How It Works

The Signal adapter uses HTTP polling:

1. Every 2 seconds, it sends `GET /v1/receive/{number}` to the signal-cli API
2. New messages are converted to `InboundMessage` events
3. Responses are sent via `POST /v2/send` to the signal-cli API

### No Streaming

Signal doesn't support message editing, so responses are accumulated and sent as a complete message.

## Installation

Signal support uses `httpx` (a core dependency), so no extra installation is needed:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh
```
