# Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is PocketPaw's default interface. It provides a real-time chat experience with session management, tool activity monitoring, and full configuration capabilities.

## Starting the Dashboard

```bash
# Default mode — starts the web dashboard
pocketpaw

# Specify host and port
export POCKETCLAW_DASHBOARD_HOST="0.0.0.0"
export POCKETCLAW_DASHBOARD_PORT=8000
pocketpaw
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Architecture

The dashboard is built with:

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Jinja2 templates
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML (no build step)
- **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time streaming
- **State**: `StateManager` with localStorage + LRU cache

### WebSocket Protocol

The dashboard communicates with the backend over WebSocket. Key message types:

| Action | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `message` | Client → Server | Send a chat message |
| `response_chunk` | Server → Client | Streaming response chunk |
| `stream_end` | Server → Client | End of streaming response |
| `tool_start` | Server → Client | Tool execution started |
| `tool_result` | Server → Client | Tool execution completed |
| `switch_session` | Client → Server | Switch to a different session |
| `new_session` | Client → Server | Create a new session |

### Feature Module System

The frontend uses a feature module auto-discovery system:

```javascript
// feature-loader.js discovers and loads all feature modules
// Each module registers itself with:
window.featureModules = window.featureModules || [];
window.featureModules.push({
  name: 'channels',
  init: () => initChannels(),
  cleanup: () => cleanupChannels()
});
```

This makes it easy to add new frontend features without modifying the core application code.
