# Microsoft Teams

PocketPaw integrates with Microsoft Teams via the **Bot Framework SDK**. This is ideal for enterprise environments that use Teams as their primary collaboration tool.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register a bot">
    1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
    2. Create a new Bot Channels Registration
    3. Note the App ID and generate a password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure messaging endpoint">
    Set the messaging endpoint to your server's public URL:
    ```
    https://your-server.com/api/messages/teams
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure PocketPaw">
    ```bash
    export POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_APP_ID="your-app-id"
    export POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start">
    ```bash
    pocketpaw --teams
    ```
    Or start via the web dashboard's Channels modal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

| Setting | Env Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| App ID | `POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_APP_ID` | Bot Framework App ID |
| App password | `POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD` | Bot Framework password |
| Tenant ID | `POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_TENANT_ID` | Azure tenant ID (optional) |
| Allowed teams | `POCKETCLAW_TEAMS_ALLOWED_TEAM_IDS` | Comma-separated team IDs |

## Features

### Webhook-Based

The Teams adapter exposes a webhook endpoint at `/api/messages/teams`. The Bot Framework sends activities to this endpoint when users interact with the bot.

### No Streaming

Teams messages are accumulated and sent as a complete response when the agent finishes processing.

### Session Keys

Each conversation gets a unique session: `teams:{conversation_id}`

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pocketpaw.xyz/install.sh | sh

# Or add the Teams extra manually
pip install pocketpaw[teams]
```

This installs the `botbuilder-core` SDK as an optional dependency.

<Callout type="info">
  Microsoft Teams integration requires a public URL for the webhook endpoint. Use the web dashboard or set up a reverse proxy with a public domain.
</Callout>
