# Skills System

Skills are persistent markdown files that teach PocketPaw how to handle specific types of tasks. They're loaded into the agent's context on every interaction.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a SKILL.md file stored in `~/.pocketclaw/skills/`. Each skill defines:

- **When to activate** — Trigger phrases or conditions
- **How to execute** — Step-by-step instructions
- **What tools to use** — Tool chains and sequences
- **Output format** — Expected response structure

## Creating Skills

### Via the Skill Generator Tool

The agent can create skills using the `skill_gen` tool:

```
User: Create a skill for writing daily standup summaries
Agent: [uses skill_gen] → Created skill: daily-standup.md
```

### Manually

Create a markdown file in `~/.pocketclaw/skills/`:

```markdown
# Code Review Skill

## Trigger
When the user asks to review code, a PR, or a diff.

## Steps
1. Read the file or diff provided
2. Analyze for:
   - Bug risks
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
   - Code style
3. Provide structured feedback

## Output Format
### Summary
Brief overall assessment.

### Issues Found
- **[severity]** Description of issue (line X)

### Suggestions
- Improvement suggestions
```

## Skill Loading

Skills are loaded by the `AgentContextBuilder`:

1. On startup, all `*.md` files in `~/.pocketclaw/skills/` are read
2. Skill content is injected into the system prompt
3. The agent uses skills as reference when handling matching requests
4. After creating a new skill via `skill_gen`, the loader is reloaded

## Skill Directory

```
~/.pocketclaw/skills/
├── daily-standup.md
├── code-review.md
├── meeting-notes.md
└── git-workflow.md
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep skills focused** — One skill per task type
2. **Be specific** — Clear trigger conditions prevent false matches
3. **Include examples** — Show the expected output format
4. **Reference tools** — Specify which tools to use
5. **Test and iterate** — Try the skill and refine it
