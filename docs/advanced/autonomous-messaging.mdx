# Autonomous Messaging

PocketPaw can send messages proactively — without waiting for user input. This is powered by three components: the **Proactive Daemon** (orchestrator), **Intentions** (scheduled behaviors), and the **Channel Notifier** (delivery).

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Proactive Daemon          │
│  (orchestrates intentions)      │
├──────────┬──────────────────────┤
│ Trigger  │  Intention           │
│ Engine   │  Executor            │
│ (cron)   │  (runs agent)        │
└────┬─────┴──────────┬───────────┘
     │                │
     ▼                ▼
  APScheduler    Channel Notifier
  fires trigger  → delivers to channels
```

## Intentions

An intention is a scheduled agent behavior — a prompt that runs on a trigger.

### Intention Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Human-readable name (e.g., "Morning Standup") |
| `prompt` | string | The prompt to send to the agent |
| `trigger` | object | When to fire (cron schedule) |
| `context_sources` | array | Additional context to inject (e.g., `system_status`) |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether the intention is active |

### Creating Intentions

```
User: Every weekday at 8 AM, check my calendar and summarize today's meetings
Agent: Created intention "Daily Calendar Brief" — triggers Mon-Fri at 8:00 AM
```

### Trigger Types

Currently supports cron triggers with standard 5-field expressions:

```
minute  hour  day  month  day_of_week
  0       8    *     *       1-5        (weekdays at 8 AM)
```

Common presets are available:

| Preset | Schedule |
|--------|----------|
| `every_minute` | `* * * * *` |
| `every_5_minutes` | `*/5 * * * *` |
| `every_hour` | `0 * * * *` |
| `every_morning_8am` | `0 8 * * *` |
| `weekday_morning_8am` | `0 8 * * 1-5` |
| `daily_noon` | `0 12 * * *` |
| `weekly_monday_9am` | `0 9 * * 1` |
| `monthly_first_9am` | `0 9 1 * *` |

### Intention Lifecycle

1. **Create** — Define name, prompt, trigger, and context sources
2. **Schedule** — Trigger engine registers the cron job
3. **Fire** — When the trigger fires, the executor runs the agent with the prompt
4. **Deliver** — Results are streamed to the dashboard and optionally pushed to channels
5. **Repeat** — The trigger re-schedules for the next occurrence

## Channel Notifier

The notifier delivers messages to any configured channel without user interaction.

### Configuration

Set notification targets in settings as `"channel:chat_id"` strings:

```bash
export POCKETCLAW_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS='["telegram:123456789","discord:987654321","slack:C0A1B2C3D"]'
```

Supported channel formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| `telegram:{chat_id}` | `telegram:123456789` |
| `discord:{channel_id}` | `discord:987654321` |
| `slack:{channel_id}` | `slack:C0A1B2C3D` |
| `whatsapp:{phone}` | `whatsapp:+1234567890` |
| `signal:{phone}` | `signal:+1234567890` |
| `matrix:{room_id}` | `matrix:!abc:matrix.org` |
| `teams:{conversation_id}` | `teams:19:abc@thread.v2` |
| `gchat:{space}` | `gchat:spaces/abc123` |

### Usage Points

The notifier is called by:
- **Scheduler** — When reminders trigger
- **Proactive Daemon** — When intentions execute
- **Deep Work** — Human task notifications and project completion alerts
- **Dashboard** — Broadcast messages

## Owner ID

Set the `owner_id` to identify yourself. This enables the memory system to distinguish between your messages and those from other users on shared channels.

```bash
export POCKETCLAW_OWNER_ID="your_telegram_user_id"
```

## Persistence

- Intentions are stored in `~/.pocketclaw/intentions.json`
- Notification channel targets are stored in config
- The daemon reloads all intentions on startup and re-schedules triggers

## Dashboard Integration

The web dashboard provides:
- View and manage all intentions
- Toggle intentions on/off
- Trigger an intention manually
- See next scheduled run time
- Stream execution results in real time
