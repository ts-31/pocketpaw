# Cron Scheduler

PocketPaw includes a built-in task scheduler for recurring reminders and scheduled actions.

## Features

- **Recurring tasks** — Schedule tasks with cron-like expressions
- **Persistence** — Recurring tasks survive restarts
- **Re-scheduling** — Tasks automatically re-schedule after execution
- **Management** — Add and delete recurring tasks via tools

## How It Works

The scheduler is built on APScheduler and manages two types of tasks:

### One-time Reminders

```
User: Remind me to check the build in 30 minutes
Agent: Set a reminder for 2:30 PM — "Check the build"
```

### Recurring Tasks

```
User: Every Monday at 9 AM, summarize my calendar for the week
Agent: Created recurring task: "Weekly calendar summary" — Every Monday at 9:00 AM
```

## API

The scheduler provides two main functions:

### add_recurring

```python
from pocketclaw.scheduler import scheduler

scheduler.add_recurring(
    task_id="weekly-summary",
    cron_expression="0 9 * * 1",  # Every Monday at 9 AM
    callback=async_function,
    kwargs={"session_id": "..."},
)
```

### delete_recurring

```python
scheduler.delete_recurring("weekly-summary")
```

## Persistence

Recurring tasks are persisted to the config and re-loaded on startup. One-time reminders are stored in memory and lost on restart.

## Cron Expression Format

Standard cron format: `minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week`

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9:00 AM |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Every 30 minutes |
| `0 8,17 * * 1-5` | 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays |
| `0 0 1 * *` | First day of every month at midnight |
